## Blog Post 1: My Origin Story â€” Why I Started Open Source Pickle

When I first started my career in IT, I quickly realized that the path was not always straightforward. There were long nights spent troubleshooting user issues, weekends buried in documentation, and countless hours of trial and error. But what kept me going was not just solving technical challenges â€” it was the thrill of learning, teaching, and building systems that empowered people to do their best work.

### The Beginning
Growing up, I didnâ€™t have the latest gadgets or access to top-tier labs, but I did have curiosity and determination. I tinkered with old computers, broke them, fixed them, and learned how technology could transform how people lived and worked. That early spark led me to pursue IT support, where I found myself not only solving problems but also documenting processes so others could benefit from the lessons learned.

### The Turning Point
As I advanced in my roles, I noticed a gap: many IT teams were reactive, stuck in firefighting mode. Documentation was inconsistent, knowledge was siloed, and onboarding was painful for new hires. I knew there had to be a better way.

Thatâ€™s when I began working on what would eventually become **Open Source Pickle** â€” a space to collect, refine, and share IT playbooks, automation scripts, and best practices openly. The name? A little quirky, yes, but it reflects two things: the *open source* ethos of collaboration and my own knack for finding myself in technical *pickles* and figuring a way out.

### Wins Along the Way
- Migrating hundreds of Macs from Jamf to Intune with minimal downtime.
- Automating onboarding scripts that cut setup time for new hires in half.
- Building security checklists that helped keep compliance with frameworks like NIST and CIS.
- Mentoring junior IT staff to not just fix issues, but understand and document them.

### Why Iâ€™m Doing This
I believe knowledge should not be hoarded â€” it should be shared. Open Source Pickle is my way of giving back to the IT community while building a portfolio that shows not only what Iâ€™ve done, but how others can replicate and improve on it.

This isnâ€™t just about my career growth â€” itâ€™s about empowering others. If even one person finds a script, a guide, or a blog post here that saves them hours of frustration, then Iâ€™ve accomplished my mission.
